# Splunk Enterprise Setup Guide


This project documents the step-by-step procedure originally executed in a Google Colab environment, now adapted into Markdown format for professional GitHub repositories.

The goal is to make the content clear, organized, and reusable by any Splunk analyst or architect aiming to install and configure **Splunk ES 8.0.2**.

## Introduction

This guide provides a detailed procedure for installing and configuring Splunk Enterprise. Aimed at technology engineers, it facilitates leveraging machine data. Learn to transform your data into operational intelligence.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

* A supported operating system installed. Check [here](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.4.1/Installation/Systemrequirements) for the list of supportes OS.
* A valid Splunk Enterprise license.
* Root permissions on OS.
* Your OS mus have proper internet connectivity.
* Python execution environment.
* All necessary ports are opened. See the [Firewall Preparation](https://github.com/splunkcep/splunk_platform/blob/main/OS_preparation/FirewallPrep_EN.md) file to see step-by-step instructions to prepare your OS firewall for Splunk enterprise installation
* Transparent Hughe Pages (THP) are disables on the OS. See the [Disable THP](https://github.com/splunkcep/splunk_platform/blob/main/OS_preparation/Disable_THP_EN.md) file to see  step-by-step instructions on how to disable THP.


## Installing Splunk Enterprise on Linux

### 1. Accessing the Server via SSH

Open a terminal and connect to the server via SSH:

`ssh User_Name@<Server_IP>`

* Replace:
    * User_Name by the operating system or domain user.
    * <SERVER_IP> with the actual IP of the host where you want to install Splunk.


### 2. Creating a User for Splunk

To ensure a secure installation, we will create a dedicated user to run Splunk:

```bash
# Let's create a user called splunkuser.
sudo useradd -m -r splunkuser

# Now, we have to define a password for it
sudo passwd splunkuser
```


### 3. Adding the Splunk User to the Sudo/Wheel Group

1. Add splunkuser to the sudo group:

CentOS / RHEL
```bash
sudo usermod -aG wheel splunkuser
```

UBUNTU ??? #Validate this is true for UBUNTU
```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo splunkuser
```

2. Verify that the addition was successful
```bash
groups splunkuser
```

3. Switch to bash

CentOS / RHEL
```bash
# Validate your SHELL, which should be /bin/bash
su splunkuser
echo $SHELL  
```


UBUNTU ??? #Validate this is true for UBUNTU
```bash
su splunkuser
sudo chsh -s /bin/bash splunkuser
```

Apply the changes by logging out and logging back in as splunkuser:
```bash
su - splunkuser
```

4. Downloading the Splunk Installer

Go to https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html and
* Log in if requested (requires Splunk.com user)
* Select *Linux* as Operating System
* at the *.tgz* option, click on *Copy wget link* and copy the wget command shown


Execute the command sith sudo. This downloads Splunk Enterprise version 9.X.X.

```bash
# This is an EXAMPLE. Use the wget command copyed from the download page.
cd /home/splunkuser/
sudo wget -O splunk-9.4.1-e3bdab203ac8-linux-amd64.tgz "https://download.splunk.com/products/splunk/releases/9.4.1/linux/splunk-9.4.1-e3bdab203ac8-linux-amd64.tgz"
```

Now, go to the directory you downloaded the file and validate the file is found

```bash
cd /home/splunkuser/
ls
```

5. Adjusting Permissions on the Installation File

Before installing, check the file permissions:
```bash
ls -lha /home/splunkuser
```

You will notice *splunkuser* currently has read permissions on the file but cannot execute, modify or delete it without sudo or a change in ownership or granting the proper permissions
Give execute permission to the file:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /home/splunkuser/splunk-9.4.1-e3bdab203ac8-linux-amd64.tgz
```

Double check the permissions:


```bash
ls -lha /home/splunkuser
```
The permissions are now -rwxr-xr-x. This means *splunkuser* can read the file (r) and can now execute it (x).

6. Creating the Splunk Installation Directory

The following command will create the splunk directory
```bash
sudo mkdir /opt/splunk
```
This creates the folder, but only *root* has permissions over it. You can check it running

```bash
ls -lha /opt/splunk
```

Then, let's change the owner of the folder to the splunkuser user and validate the permissions


```bash
#Changes the ownership of the folder
sudo chown -R splunkuser:splunkuser /opt/splunk

#checks the permissions on the folder
ls -lha /opt/splunk
```



🔹 7️⃣ Installing Splunk

Extract the downloaded file to /opt
(📌 This will install Splunk in the folder /opt/splunk):


```python
tar -xzvf splunk-9.4.1-e3bdab203ac8-linux-amd64.tgz -C /opt
```

🔹 8️⃣ Starting Splunk

Now, launch Splunk and accept the license:


```python
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk start --accept-license
```

🔑
* Splunk Default Credentials:
*	OS User: splunkuser
*	OS Password: (definida anteriormente)
*	Splunk User: admin
*	Splunk Password: splunkuser

🔹 9️⃣ Setting Splunk to Start Automatically

To ensure that Splunk starts automatically when you restart the server:


```python
sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk enable boot-start -user splunkuser --accept-license --answer-yes --no-prompt
```

This configures the Splunk service to start automatically when the system starts.

Check the startup file:


```python
sudo vi /etc/init.d/splunk
```

Add the following lines (if necessary):


```python
RETVAL=0
USER=splunkuser
. /etc/init.d/functions
```

🔹 🔄 Basic Commands to Manage Splunk

Check status


```python
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk status
```

Launch Splunk


```python
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk start
```

Stop Splunk


```python
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk stop
```

Restart Splunk


```python
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk restart
```

Splunk is now installed and configured on your Linux server. To access it via a web browser, open:


```python
http://<IP_DO_SERVIDOR>:8000
```
