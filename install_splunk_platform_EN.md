## Introduction

This guide provides a detailed procedure for installing and configuring Splunk Enterprise. Aimed at technology engineers, it facilitates leveraging machine data. Learn to transform your data into operational intelligence.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

* A supported operating system installed. Check [here](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.4.1/Installation/Systemrequirements) for the list of supportes OS.
* A valid Splunk Enterprise license.
* Root permissions on OS.
* Your OS mus have proper internet connectivity.
* Python execution environment.
* All necessary ports are opened. See the [Firewall Preparation](https://github.com/splunkcep/splunk_platform/blob/main/OS_preparation/FirewallPrep_EN.md) file to see step-by-step instructions to prepare your OS firewall for Splunk enterprise installation
* Transparent Hughe Pages (THP) are disables on the OS. See the [Disable THP](https://github.com/splunkcep/splunk_platform/blob/main/OS_preparation/Disable_THP_EN.md) file to see  step-by-step instructions on how to disable THP.


## Installing Splunk Enterprise on Linux

### 1. Accessing the Server via SSH

Open a terminal and connect to the server via SSH:

`ssh User_Name@<Server_IP>`

* Replace:
    * User_Name by the operating system or domain user.
    * <SERVER_IP> with the actual IP of the host where you want to install Splunk.


### 2. Creating a User for Splunk

To ensure a secure installation, we will create a dedicated user to run Splunk:

```bash
# Let's create a user called splunkuser.
sudo useradd -m -r splunkuser

# Now, we have to define a password for it
sudo passwd splunkuser
```


### 3. Adding the Splunk User to the Sudo/Wheel Group

1. Add splunkuser to the sudo group:

CentOS / RHEL
```bash
sudo usermod -aG wheel splunkuser
```

UBUNTU ??? #Validate this is true for UBUNTU
```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo splunkuser
```

2. Verify that the addition was successful
```bash
groups splunkuser
```

3. Switch to bash

CentOS / RHEL
```bash
# Validate your SHELL, which should be /bin/bash
su splunkuser
echo $SHELL  
```


UBUNTU ??? #Validate this is true for UBUNTU
```bash
su splunkuser
sudo chsh -s /bin/bash splunkuser
```

Apply the changes by logging out and logging back in as splunkuser:
```bash
su - splunkuser
```

### 4. Downloading the Splunk Installer

Go to https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html and
* Log in if requested (requires Splunk.com user)
* Select *Linux* as Operating System
* at the *.tgz* option, click on *Copy wget link* and copy the wget command shown


Execute the command sith sudo. This downloads Splunk Enterprise version 9.X.X.

```bash
# This is an EXAMPLE. Use the wget command copyed from the download page.
cd /home/splunkuser/
sudo wget -O splunk-9.4.1-e3bdab203ac8-linux-amd64.tgz "https://download.splunk.com/products/splunk/releases/9.4.1/linux/splunk-9.4.1-e3bdab203ac8-linux-amd64.tgz"
```

Now, go to the directory you downloaded the file and validate the file is found

```bash
cd /home/splunkuser/
ls
```

### 5. Adjusting Permissions on the Installation File

Before installing, check the file permissions:
```bash
ls -lha /home/splunkuser
```

You will notice *splunkuser* currently has read permissions on the file but cannot execute, modify or delete it without sudo or a change in ownership or granting the proper permissions
Give execute permission to the file:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /home/splunkuser/splunk-9.4.2-e9664af3d956-linux-amd64.tgz
```

Double check the permissions:

```bash
ls -lha /home/splunkuser
```
The permissions are now -rwxr-xr-x. This means *splunkuser* can read the file (r) and can now execute it (x).

### 6. Creating the Splunk Installation Directory

The following command will create the splunk directory
```bash
sudo mkdir /opt/splunk
```
This creates the folder, but only *root* has permissions over it. You can check it running

```bash
ls -lha /opt/splunk
```

Then, let's change the owner of the folder to the splunkuser user and validate the permissions

```bash
#Changes the ownership of the folder
sudo chown -R splunkuser:splunkuser /opt/splunk

#checks the permissions on the folder
ls -lha /opt/splunk
```

### 7. Installing Splunk

Extract the downloaded file to /opt. This will install Splunk in the folder /opt/splunk

```bash
tar -xzvf splunk-9.4.2-e9664af3d956-linux-amd64.tgz -C /opt
```

### 8. Starting Splunk

Now, launch Splunk and accept the license:

```bash
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk start --accept-license
```

This will prompt you to define an Administrator username and password. Set it appropiatelly.

ðŸ”‘
* Splunk Default Credentials:
*	OS User: splunkuser
*	OS Password: (previously defined)
*	Splunk User: admin
*	Splunk Password: splunkuser (or any other you define)

### 9. Setting Splunk to Start Automatically

To ensure that Splunk starts automatically when you restart the server:

```bash
sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk enable boot-start -user splunkuser --accept-license --answer-yes --no-prompt
```

This configures the Splunk service to start automatically when the system starts.

Check the startup file:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/init.d/splunk
```

Add the following lines (if necessary):

```bash
RETVAL=0
USER=splunkuser
. /etc/init.d/functions
```

## Basic Commands to Manage Splunk

Check status

```bash
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk status
```

Launch Splunk

```bash
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk start
```

Stop Splunk

```bash
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk stop
```

Restart Splunk

```bash
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk restart
```

Splunk is now installed and configured on your Linux server. To access it via a web browser, open:

```bash
http://<SERVER_IP:8000
```
